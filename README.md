## Workday List

This option helps the user keep track of specific tasks they might do throughout the day. Once the store button is clicked, the website logs the information and displays it despite the user refreshing the page.

## Time organization

This website displays the current date and day of the week at the top of the page to help the user stay organized. It also changes the workday hour boxes' color based on the time of day it is. If the box is in the past it displays as gray, if it is currently that hour it displays as red and green if it is in the future.
